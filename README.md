<h2> ‚ùî About </h2>
Hey there! I created a highly optimized discord ticket bot for the public including Buttons, Select Menu's, Customizable modals per ticket category and even a feedback system so people can rate your services! I created this bot in a short time of about 12 hours, so I have thoroughly checked for errors in this code... So, if you do find one. Make sure to let me know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/Lucass-io/Discord.JS-Ticket-System/issues/new).

<h2> üîß Setup </h2>

To take my bot in use,
1. simply <a href="https://github.com/Lucass-io/Discord.JS-Ticket-System/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">download the zipped file.</a>

2. Once you downloaded the zip file, extract the zip (in your hosting).

3. If that is done, and you want to host your bot locally. Open up a terminal and exectute the following lines: (for this you need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a> installed on your computer)
```
npm init -y
```
```
npm install discord.js
```
```
npm install discord-html-transcripts
```

3. If ur hosting via an hosting service, head to the settings page and find the "Additional node packages" (can be named differently) in there put "discord-html-transcripts" like in the picture under here.

<strong>Of course there is an option to create more categories, and it's easily done. Just go to the *ticketBot.js* file. Once there, head to line *102*. There is the select menu displayed showing the 3 pre-existing categories. To add one, copy the third category and simply change "CATEGORY_NAMES.category3" to "CATEGORY_NAMES.category4". Once that is done, head to the *tickets_config.json* file and create a "category4" line with information where needed.</strong>
